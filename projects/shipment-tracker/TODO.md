# Shipment Tracker - TODO List

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

---

## 🔥 PRIORITY 0: Critical Mobile UX Fixes (IMMEDIATE)

### Mobile Table Redesign (Critical)
- [ ] **Replace table with card-based layout on mobile**
  - Each shipment = horizontal panel/card
  - Status icon on left (visual indicator: ✅ delivered, 🚚 in transit, ⚠️ exception, etc.)
  - AWB truncated: `1...23456` (show first + last digits)
  - Tap to expand for full details
  - Full AWB shown when expanded

- [ ] **Duplicate AWB Detection**
  - If truncated AWBs look identical, show indicator (e.g., badge "2x")
  - Link to jump between duplicate AWBs
  - Visual differentiation (different colors/borders)

- [ ] **Desktop: Keep table, improve detail panel**
  - Show detail panel side-by-side with table (split view)
  - Table on left (60%), details on right (40%)
  - Resize breakpoint: > 1024px = split view, < 1024px = full overlay

### Stats Dashboard Contrast Fix (Critical)
- [ ] **Improve text/background contrast on stats cards**
  - Ensure WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast ratio)
  - Test with various color schemes
  - Add border/shadow for better separation
  - Consider solid backgrounds instead of gradients

### Filter Bar Mobile Layout (Critical)
- [ ] **Fix search criteria alignment on mobile**
  - Stack filters vertically on small screens
  - Make dropdowns full-width
  - Increase touch target size (min 44x44px)
  - Add clear visual separation between filter groups
  - Consider collapsible filter section to save space
