# Shipment Tracker - Changelog

**Project:** Shipment Tracker
**Author:** Wayne Fong (wayneef84)
**Development Assistant:** Claude Code by Anthropic
**Location:** `/projects/shipment-tracker/`

## Project History

### Origins (2026-01-22)

**Initial Concept**
The Shipment Tracker project was conceived as a utility tool to aggregate shipment tracking data from multiple carriers (DHL, FedEx, UPS) with smart API rate limiting and offline-first storage. Unlike the entertainment-focused games in `/games/`, this project serves a practical business/productivity need.

**Design Philosophy**
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Users provide their own API keys for privacy and cost control
- **Offline-First**: IndexedDB storage allows full functionality without constant internet connection
- **Smart Querying**: Intelligent rate limiting prevents wasting API calls on delivered items or recently-checked shipments
- **Data Preservation**: Raw API payloads stored alongside normalized data for debugging and audit trails
- **Future-Proof**: Adapter pattern allows seamless migration from IndexedDB to Firebase/Supabase

## Version History

### v1.1.0 (2026-01-23) - Mobile UX Overhaul

**🎯 Focus: Enhanced Mobile Experience + Multi-Carrier Support**

#### 🎨 Mobile UI Improvements
- **Mobile Bottom Bar** - Replaced FAB buttons with 2-row control bar
  - Row 1: Active | Delivered | Issues (stat filters with live counts)
  - Row 2: Total | Add | Filter (action buttons)
  - Click filters to show/hide shipments by status
  - Active state highlighting shows which filter is applied
  - Auto-updates counts as data changes
  - Safe area insets for notched devices

- **Full AWB Display on Mobile** - Removed AWB truncation
  - Mobile cards now show full tracking number (no `12...56789` truncation)
  - More readable and allows direct copy/paste
  - Duplicate detection still works (compares first 2 + last 5 chars)
  - Duplicate badge shows count when similar AWBs exist (e.g., "2x")

- **Carrier Website Links** - Click to track on carrier site
  - AWBs are now clickable links to official tracking pages
  - Desktop: Blue links in AWB table column
  - Mobile: Clickable AWB in card header + "Track on {Carrier}" button
  - Opens in new tab with secure `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
  - Supports DHL, FedEx, UPS with proper URL formats

#### 🚚 Multi-Carrier Support
- **FedEx API Adapter** (`js/api/fedex.js`)
  - Mock data generator for testing without API keys
  - OAuth 2.0 implementation (stubbed for future use)
  - Realistic event timeline generation
  - Test tracking numbers: `111111111111` (delivered), `222222222222` (in transit)
  - Configurable sandbox/production endpoints
  - Rate limiting: 1000 req/day, 5 req/sec

- **UPS API Adapter** (`js/api/ups.js`)
  - Mock data generator for testing without API keys
  - OAuth 2.0 implementation (stubbed for future use)
  - UPS-specific status codes and events
  - Test tracking numbers: `1Z999AA10123456780` (delivered), `1Z999AA10123456784` (in transit)
  - Configurable test/production endpoints
  - Rate limiting: 500 req/day, 2 req/sec

- **Test Data Documentation** (`TEST_DATA.md`)
  - Official DHL sandbox tracking numbers (6 test AWBs)
  - FedEx test tracking numbers with status scenarios

    - Clear All Data (with confirmation)
  - **Real-time Stats:**
    - Tracking count display
    - Estimated DB size (KB/MB)
  - Overlay modal with dark backdrop
  - Close via button, overlay click, or `Ctrl+Shift+D` again

#### 📝 Utility Enhancements
- **Carrier Tracking URL Generator** (`TrackingUtils.getCarrierTrackingURL()`)
  - Returns official carrier tracking page URLs
  - Properly encodes AWB numbers
  - Handles DHL, FedEx, UPS with correct query parameters

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate AWB detection logic (now works with full AWB display)
- Improved mobile bottom bar spacing for safe areas
- Desktop stats container now hidden on mobile (bottom bar replaces it)
- Mobile cards container padding adjusted for bottom bar height (140px)

#### 📦 New Files
- `js/api/fedex.js` - FedEx Track API adapter
- `js/api/ups.js` - UPS Track API adapter
- `js/debug.js` - Debug menu module
- `TEST_DATA.md` - Test tracking numbers and mock data guide

#### 🔧 Modified Files
- `index.html` - Added debug menu HTML, mobile bottom bar, new script tags
- `css/style.css` - Added bottom bar styles, debug menu styles, removed FAB styles
- `js/utils.js` - Added `getCarrierTrackingURL()` function
- `js/app.js` - Bottom bar handlers, full AWB display, debug menu initialization
- `TODO.md` - Marked completed features (mobile cards, carrier adapters, debug menu)

## Technical Decisions

### Why IndexedDB over localStorage?
- **Capacity**: 50MB+ vs 5-10MB
- **Structured Data**: Built-in indexing for fast queries
- **Async API**: Non-blocking operations
- **Future-Proof**: Easy migration to cloud databases

### Why Store Raw Payloads?
- **Debugging**: Compare normalized vs raw data
- **Re-normalization**: Improve logic without re-querying APIs
- **Audit Trail**: Prove what carrier returned at specific time
- **Carrier-Specific Features**: Preserve unique fields not in normalized schema

### Why Delivery Signal Buckets?
- **Consistency**: DHL/FedEx/UPS use different status codes
- **Cross-Carrier Filtering**: "Show all out-for-delivery" works universally
- **Terminal Detection**: Auto-stop querying delivered items

### Why Adapter Pattern?
- **Migration Path**: Seamlessly switch from IndexedDB to Firebase
- **Testability**: Mock adapters for unit testing
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple storage backends simultaneously

### Why BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)?
- **Privacy**: User controls their data, no centralized API keys
- **Cost**: User pays for their own usage (free tiers are generous)
- **Rate Limits**: No sharing limits across users
- **Compliance**: User responsible for carrier API terms
